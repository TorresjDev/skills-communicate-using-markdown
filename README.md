## Welcome

GitHub is about more than code. It's a platform for software collaboration, and Markdown is one of the most important ways developers can make their communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests. This course will walk you through creating and using headings more effectively, organizing thoughts in bulleted lists, and showing how much work you've completed with checklists. You can even use Markdown to add some depth to your work with the help of emoji, images, and links.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, and students.
- **What you'll learn**: Use Markdown to add lists, images, and links in a comment or text file.
- **What you'll build**: We'll update a plain text file and add Markdown formatting, and you can use this file to start your own GitHub Pages site.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with pull requests as well as edit files. If these things aren't familiar to you, we recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course, first!
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Add headers
2. Add an image
3. Add a code example
4. Make a task list
5. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

Simply copy the exercise to your account, then give your favorite Octocat (Mona) **about 20 seconds** to prepare the first lesson, then **refresh the page**.

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds:

1. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the issue created in your repository.
3. If the page doesn't refresh automatically, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
   - Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
   - If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
